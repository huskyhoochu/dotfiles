# Claude Code Automated Work Distribution System

An intelligent task distribution system that automatically routes work to specialized development agents based on task complexity, domain expertise, and enforces consistent use of MCP tools for optimal quality and efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🤖 Intelligent Agent Routing
- **File Extension Analysis**: `.go` → golang-pro, `.ts` → typescript-pro, `.rs` → rust-engineer
- **Project Type Detection**: `go.mod` → Go projects, `package.json` → TypeScript/Node.js
- **Keyword Classification**: "architecture" → backend experts, "React" → frontend specialists  
- **Complexity Evaluation**: Simple questions handled directly, complex tasks routed to specialists

### 🧠 Enforced MCP Integration
- **Sequential Thinking**: Mandatory for all complex architecture design and multi-step planning
- **Serena**: Required for all code reading, writing, searching, and refactoring operations

## 📋 Current Agent Portfolio

| Agent | Specialization | Primary Tools |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **work-distributor** | Task routing, coordination | sequential-thinking, serena |
| **golang-pro** | Go, microservices, backend architecture | go, gofmt, delve |
| **typescript-pro** | TypeScript, type safety, build optimization | tsc, eslint, webpack |
| **frontend-developer** | React, Vue, Angular, UI/UX | playwright, magic |
| **nextjs-fullstack-expert** | Next.js full-stack development | - |
| **postgres-pro** | PostgreSQL, database optimization | psql, pgbench |
| **react-specialist** | React ecosystem, component design | - |
| **rust-engineer** | Rust, systems programming | - |
| **code-reviewer** | Code quality, security analysis | eslint, sonarqube |

## 🔄 Task Distribution Process

### 1. Request Analysis (Sequential Thinking)
```
User Request → sequential-thinking MCP → Complexity & Domain Analysis → Agent Selection
```

### 2. Intelligent Routing Rules

**File-Based Routing:**
```
.go files → @golang-pro
.ts/.js files → @typescript-pro  
.sql files → @postgres-pro
.rs files → @rust-engineer
```

**Keyword-Based Routing:**
```
"goroutine", "microservice" → @golang-pro
"type safety", "generic" → @typescript-pro
"database", "query optimization" → @postgres-pro
"component", "responsive" → @frontend-developer
```

**Project Context Routing:**
```
go.mod present → Go project → @golang-pro
package.json present → TypeScript/Node → @typescript-pro
Cargo.toml present → Rust project → @rust-engineer
```

### 3. MCP Tool Enforcement

**Sequential Thinking Required For:**
- Complex architecture design
- Multi-step implementation planning
- Performance optimization strategies
- System integration projects

**Serena MCP Required For:**
- All code reading and analysis
- Function/type/pattern searching
- New code implementation
- Refactoring and optimization

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Go Microservice Development
```
Request: "Implement gRPC user authentication service with JWT tokens"
→ work-distributor analysis
→ "Go", "gRPC", "microservice" keywords detected
→ @golang-pro delegation
→ sequential-thinking for architecture + serena for implementation
```

### React Component Development
```
Request: "Create responsive user profile dashboard with TypeScript"
→ work-distributor analysis  
→ "React", "component", "TypeScript" keywords detected
→ @frontend-developer delegation
→ sequential-thinking for design + serena for component code
```

### Database Optimization
```
Request: "Optimize PostgreSQL queries for analytics workload"
→ work-distributor analysis
→ "PostgreSQL", "optimization" keywords detected
→ @postgres-pro delegation
→ sequential-thinking for strategy + serena for SQL analysis
```

### Code Quality Review
```
Request: "Review this Go codebase for security and performance issues"
→ work-distributor analysis
→ "review", "security" keywords detected
→ @code-reviewer delegation
→ sequential-thinking for review strategy + serena for code analysis
```
